# Roadmap

- Helper to check if a variable is defined and set a default value if it's not. => See branch `2.0.0-defined` and https://github.com/Vadorequest/ejs-locals/issues/1 *Need some advice there.*
- Disable log when a file is found, but I don't know how to check this kind of configuration. Maybe a `.ejs-locals` at the root with configuration based on the environment would be a good idea?
