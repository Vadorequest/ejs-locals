# Contributing

If you want to contribute, you can make a PR. Please **add tests** and/or **enough explanation** for me to understand the changes and test them.
I don't know nor understand the whole library yet, even if I'm getting used to.

## Environment
In order to simplify the process, I've decided to use TypeScript, you will need a TS compiler then.
I use WebStorm which automatically recompile files when I save them. *(It is the best IDE for node.js btw)*

**To install typescript:**
`npm i -g typescript`

**To compile a file manually:**
`tsc helloworld.ts`
